  <p>AJLogin is a user management script written in classic ASP that can be very easily integrated into existing web and intranet sites. The script uses a <strong>Microsoft Access</strong> database to store member account details and session variables to determine if a site visitor is logged-in.</p>
  <p>Your web host must support <strong>ASP</strong> and <strong>ADODB</strong> in order to use AJLogin. In order to use any of the features involving e-mail, your web host must also support <strong>CDONTS</strong> or <strong>CDOSYS</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>The script allows visitors to your site to register for membership in order to access &quot;members only&quot; pages that you designate. Over the years, the feature list has been expanded to include:</p>
  <ul class="features">
  <li>A browser-based control panel for site admins</li>
  <li>Optional e-mail address verification for new members</li>
  <li>&quot;Keep me logged-in&quot; functionality</li>
  <li>Fully automated password reminder e-mails</li>
  <li>A built in messaging system that allows for quick and painless group e-mails to the members of your site.</li>
  <li>E-mail alerts for site administrators when a new user registers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please keep in mind that <strong>protected pages must use the <code>.asp</code> file extension</strong> (e.g. <code>members.asp</code> as opposed to <code>members.htm</code> or <code>members.html</code>). Don't be afraid to change the extension of existing <code>.htm</code> and <code>.html</code> files to <code>.asp</code> for the purposes of protecting them; the pages will display exactly the same (but you should obviously take care to update all links that point to the page). Instructions for protecting pages can be found below.</p>
